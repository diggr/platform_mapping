# DIGGR PLATFORM MAPPING

The diggr platform mapping provides a mapping for platform strings of various video game databases.
It is meant to ease mapping and matching of releases, local releases or games in general which are to be found in these databases.

This is meant as a first step towards unification of platform identification.

The list is not exhaustive.

Everything is provided as is and comes without any warranty.

In some data sources there are platform groups (like "Game Archives") which includes individual platforms.
A mapping is located at _platform_groups.tsv_ in the tabular_data folder.

The file _diggr_vocab.tsv_ contains the whole standarized vocabulary we used for internal mappings. It also contains links to the [GAMECIP](https://gamemetadata.soe.ucsc.edu/platform) Platform Vocabulary.
